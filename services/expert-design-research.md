You have the beginnings of a product or service but need more insight about your customers to make it shine. You want proper research done but you can't afford a full-time UX or Product Designer.

That’s where I come in! Book me in for a four week Design Research phase, and I’ll give you a comprehensive overview of where your journeys are falling down, and how to fix them. 


## This package includes

### Video consultation &amp; questionnaire
We'll do some prep together to zone in on your unique design needs and to identify the Research deliverables which best serve your objectives.

### XXXX
Over a few weeks, I will analyse your data and research your visitors' behaviour, identifying bottlenecks and working out how to clear them.

### Best-practice recommendations
We will get together for a debrief to go through my insights and prioritised recommendations, handing it over to you and your team &mdash; use this to kick-start your backlog!

Your business is online, plenty of people visit your site, but they don’t sign up or buy at the rate you expected them to. There must be bottlenecks somewhere... only you don’t know how to find them.

That’s where I come in! Book me in for a User Experience Checkup, and I’ll give you a comprehensive overview of where your journeys are falling down, and how to fix them. 

## This package includes

{% capture steps %}
### Video consultation &amp; questionnaire
{:.package-step}
I'll get to know your product and work with you to build a solid understanding of the challenges you're facing, and how I can help you. We will also identify your success metrics for this effort so we can track progress.

### UX heavy lifting
{:.package-step}
I will deep-dive into as many sources of information about your product as I can (analytics, existing customer insight, support tickets, anything you got). I will also conduct an expert usability review, relying on industry standard heuristics to identify bottlenecks and experiential issues that could hamper your growth. This will give me a comprehensive picture of where you could be making improvements to meet your business goals.

### Best-practice recommendations
{:.package-step}
We will get together for a debrief to go through my insights and prioritised recommendations, handing actionable learnings over to you and your team &mdash; use this to kick-start your backlog! 

(If you need design support past this point, we can also discuss that.)

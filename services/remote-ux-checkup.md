Your business is online, plenty of people visit your site, but they don’t sign up or buy at the rate you expected them to. There must be bottlenecks somewhere... only you don’t know how to find them.

That’s where I come in! Book me in for a User Experience Checkup, and I’ll give you a comprehensive overview of where your journeys are falling down, and how to fix them. 


## This package includes

### Video consultation &amp; questionnaire
We'll do some prep together to zone in on your unique design needs and to identify the Research deliverables which best serve your objectives.

### UX heavy lifting
Over a few weeks, I will analyse your data and research your visitors' behaviour, identifying bottlenecks and working out how to clear them.

### Best-practice recommendations
We will get together for a debrief to go through my insights and prioritised recommendations, handing it over to you and your team &mdash; use this to kick-start your backlog!

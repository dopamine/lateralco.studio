# Hi there, it's Zita here
{:.hero}

I’m here to take the mystery out of getting to know your customers, so that you can make your online presence work even harder for you.
{:.lead}

As a well established Senior Product Designer, I specialise in early stage idea validation, interaction design and usability best practice. Designing for complex, data heavy or tightly regulated problem spaces is my jam — I will pick up your domain at record speeds, then create appropriate solutions that delight users and meet your business goals.

Based out of bonnie Scotland, I'm available for remote projects across the UK and beyond. Does any of the above sound like you and your business? Let's talk.

## Previous happy clients

I have worked across a variety of industries, from startups through scaleups to mega corporations; from cloud marketing and healthcare to accounting and finance:

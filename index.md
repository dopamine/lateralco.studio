{% include container.html class="section narrow valueprop" content=intro %}

{% capture section-research %}
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/undraw-design-research.png){:.service-img.img-pull-left}

### Expert Design Research
When you have the beginnings of a product or service but need just a bit more insight about your customers to make it shine, a quick design discovery project will help set you off on the right track.

{% include container.html class="section service" content=section-research %}

{% capture section-review %}
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/undraw-ux-checkup.png){:.service-img.img-pull-right}

### Remote UX Checkup
If you already have some firm ideas about what you’ll build but just want a bit more confidence, or perhaps you already launched your product and need to identify and eradicate any pain points, you need a fast round of experience design review.
